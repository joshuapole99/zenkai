# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Body stats + protein calculator**
  - Onboarding now has 5 steps: class → goal → fitness level → body stats → character name
  - Step 4 collects weight (kg), height (cm), age with numeric inputs; "Skip for now" bypasses without blocking
  - Live preview: protein goal appears below weight field as user types (`weight × 1.8g`)
  - `POST /api/onboarding` saves `weight_kg`, `height_cm`, `age`, `protein_goal` to users table
  - `protein_goal = round(weight_kg × 1.8)` stored as integer
  - Dashboard: "Daily Protein Goal: Xg" shown under HP bar in green (only visible if stat was set)
  - Users who skipped body stats see no protein goal line — no empty state shown

### Added
- **Visual structure** — asset inventory + placeholder system for all future art
  - `lib/visuals.ts` — typed registry for all image paths: characters (saiyan/assassin/guardian × 3 levels), NPCs (Kael, Ryo + variants), backgrounds (7 scenes), enemies (5 grunts + 3 bosses)
  - Helper exports: `NPC_NAMES`, `NPC_COLORS`, `CLASS_COLORS`, `getCharacterImage(class, level)`
  - `/public/images/` folders created: `characters/`, `npc/`, `bg/`, `enemies/`
  - Placeholder logic in components: `onError` hides broken img, colored div + label shows instead
- **Story screen — background + NPC** — each day now has a scene and character
  - `lib/story.ts`: `background` + `npc` fields on every day and `zenkaiBoost`; day 3 uses Ryo, day 7 uses kaelProud, Zenkai Boost uses zenkai bg
  - `StoryScreen`: background image fills screen at 35% opacity (fades in on load); dark overlay for readability; NPC placeholder box bottom-left of dialogue box; speaker chip name driven by NPC key; dialogue box gets `pl-16` padding to clear NPC image
  - `StoryData` type updated in dashboard page to include `background` + `npc`
- **Character image on dashboard** — character card shows class-colored placeholder (orange/purple/gray) sized 72×96px; image path comes from `getCharacterImage(class, level)`; `onError` hides broken `<img>` so placeholder text shows; stage label (Lv.1/2/3) shown inside placeholder

### Added (backlog)
- **Enemies & Combat** section: daily enemy defeated by completing workout, enemy HP per exercise, grunt types
- **Weekly Boss** section: The Shadow General → Ryo → Dark Self progression
- **Friends & Co-op** section: search, requests, co-op story arcs, shared power boost
- **Leaderboard** section: global XP, streak, power level, friends-only, always-visible rank

### Added
- **Story engine** — daily narrative RPG flow using data from `lib/story.ts`
  - `story_day` + `last_story_date` columns added to users table (lazy migration)
  - On dashboard load: if story not read today → `StoryScreen` overlay renders first (full-screen)
  - `StoryScreen`: chapter badge, chapter title, RPG dialogue box with "Master Kael" speaker chip, typewriter text reveal (22ms/char), tap-to-reveal-all, "Accept Quest" button, skip option; orange/purple theme; gold theme for Zenkai Boost
  - On "Accept Quest": POST `/api/story/read` saves `last_story_date = today`, transitions to workout view
  - After all quests complete: `CompletionScreen` overlay fades in (700ms delay)
  - `CompletionScreen`: animated XP counter (counts up to 100), power level badge, Master Kael completion quote (italic), next chapter teaser with chapter title, "Continue" button
  - On "Continue": POST `/api/story/advance` increments `story_day` (1→7, clamps at 7); Zenkai Boost does not advance story day
  - **Zenkai Boost**: triggered when `story_day > 1` AND `last_streak_date` is 7+ days ago; shows golden screen design with special intro/completion text; resumes normal arc afterward
  - `GET /api/story/read` + `GET /api/story/advance` API routes
- **Founding Member system** — on signup, email is cross-checked against `waitlist_zenkai`; if match, `is_founding_member = true` and `founding_member_since = NOW()` set automatically
  - Dashboard: gold character name, gold "Founding Member" badge, "Founding Member — Origin Arc" line, "Exclusive skin unlocks at official launch" note
  - Onboarding: special full-screen "Founding Member Detected" interstitial with perks list and "Claim your spot" CTA before character creation; onboarding is now a server component wrapping `OnboardingClient`
  - Signup page: subtle open beta banner ("Open Beta — You are one of the first...")
  - Landing page waitlist section: disclaimer text about open beta and skin delivery at launch
- **Story data** (`lib/story.ts`) — full 7-day Origin Arc with Master Kael and rival Ryo; Zenkai Boost arc for comeback after missed days; each day has intro, quest, completion text, XP reward; day 7 triggers arc complete
- **Exercise library** (`exercises` table) — 27 exercises across 5 categories (push, pull, legs, core, cardio) × 3 difficulties (beginner, intermediate, advanced); auto-created and seeded on first dashboard load
- **Quest swap feature** — "Swap" button on each uncompleted quest card opens inline alternative picker; fetches 3 exercises matching user's fitness level from the exercise library; user picks one → replaces quest display for that day; saved in `quest_swaps` table; resets next day; "swapped" badge on replaced quests
- `app/api/quest/alternatives` — GET route, returns 3 random exercises by difficulty, excludes current quest names
- `app/api/quest/swap` — POST route, upserts swap into `quest_swaps` table, returns exercise details

### Fixed
- **Level display** (`lib/quests.ts`): switched from increasing-difficulty formula (`level * 100` XP per level) to flat 100 XP per level — `level = floor(xp / 100) + 1`, `xpIntoLevel = xp % 100`, `xpRequired = 100` always. Predictable and consistent.
- **Quest "Done" on first load** (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `app/api/quest/complete/route.ts`): added `Number()` coercion when mapping `quest_id` from Neon results (driver can return integers as strings, breaking `Array.includes()` comparison); added `::date` cast in SQL WHERE clauses; added `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` to dashboard to prevent stale route cache.
- **Streak increment** (`app/api/quest/complete/route.ts`): replaced JS `new Date(Date.now() - 86400000)` "yesterday" calculation (UTC, timezone-sensitive) with PostgreSQL `${today}::date - INTERVAL '1 day'` — the DB now computes yesterday consistently relative to the same reference date.

### Docs
- **Backlog restructured** — added Bugs section (3 known issues), expanded Core product with body stats, protein calculator, custom workouts, full food log, story mode, boss quests, character evolution; added Build Priority order (13 items); added Instagram / social media item
- **ai_context.md** — added character design rules (no licensed anime IP, original-inspired only) and social media section (@zenkai_app Instagram, 1-platform focus)

### Added
- **Hero stat cards** — 3 animated preview cards below the waitlist form in the hero section
  - Level card: "Lv. 12", Saiyan Warrior, orange XP bar animates to 68%, "680 / 1000 XP"
  - Power card: "Zenkai Boost", purple bar animates to 45%, "+300 XP bonus"
  - Streak card: "14", white/muted bar animates to 82%, "Personal best"
  - Cards boot in with `bootIn` animation (1.1s delay, after rest of hero)
  - Bars animate from 0 → target width on mount via CSS transition (1s ease-out, triggered 400ms after load)
  - Exact spec: `rgba(255,255,255,0.035)` background, `rgba(255,255,255,0.07)` border, 12px radius, 14px/12px padding, 3px bar height

### Changed
- **Hero section — anime game aesthetic redesign**
  - `HeroBackground`: 4 animated energy orbs (CSS `energyPulse` keyframes), subtle orange grid overlay (80px cells), scanline CRT overlay, radial vignette — all pure CSS, no JS
  - `PowerScouter`: replaces old `PowerBar`; Dragon Ball scouter panel with HUD corner brackets, glowing animated border (`borderPulse`), sweeping scan line (`scanSweep`), monospace display; 3-phase sequence: "SCANNING\_" (blinking cursor) → count from 0 to 9,700 with ease-out → "SCAN COMPLETE" status; number glows continuously when done (`numberGlow`)
  - Hero fills full viewport height (`min-h-screen`, vertically centered)
  - All hero elements boot in with staggered `bootIn` animation (0.1s – 1.0s delays) — feels like powering up a game
  - System badge: `ANIME FITNESS RPG // SYSTEM INITIALIZED` with live orange dot
  - Title: uppercase, `clamp(2.8rem, 9vw, 6.5rem)` — game-title scale, `leading-none tracking-tighter`
  - Nav: tightened backdrop blur, reduced border opacity
  - `globals.css`: added `energyPulse`, `energyPulse2`, `scanSweep`, `bootIn`, `cursorBlink`, `numberGlow`, `borderPulse` keyframes; `.energy-orb-*`, `.scouter-border`, `.cursor-blink`, `.number-glow` utility classes
